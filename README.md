Scripts to run connect with the Jet API without paying for a service to do it for you

Yes you can pay Channel Advisor, Commerce Hub, etc... to set your store up to list on Jet.com - but if you are bootstrapping things and doing it on your own - or your company thinks that it's best to roll your own. Here are the scripts. You will need to change the key tokens obviously. So you'll need to sign up for Jet and receive your own tokens. 

Two versions of every file as each file you have to run the first one to test, and then there is the Production version (called .prod). 
You can dump all these files into a single directory on your server and just let it run. I believe there are folders that you need to have, but it's listed in the structure.

If anyone is interested, I also created a Jet Frontend for managing your Jet account - uploading SKU's, Pricing, Images, checking SKU status, etc... Since Jet doesn't provide that to you as a jet partner. You have to write your own against their API.
